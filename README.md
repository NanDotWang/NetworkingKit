# NetworkingKit

This is a homemade Networking framework, and this is the networking approach that I preferred. 

## Features
- [x] **APIResource**: Use **APIResource** to capture all api request related content.
- [x] **APIService**: Use **APIService** to load any generic **APIResource**.
- [x] **Error handling**: Proper network error handling.
